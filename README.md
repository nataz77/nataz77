### Hi, I'm Simone ðŸ‘‹
I work as a Cloud Solutions Specialist @ [AlmavivA](https://www.almaviva.it/en_GB), where I work on designing, developing and maintaining cloud-native and cloud-oriented software solutions everyday. <br/>
As a heavy user of OSS, I'm trying to commit more to contributing to various projects and tool that I use everyday, so here I am!
